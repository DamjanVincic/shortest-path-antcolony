# Shortest Path Problem - Antcolony Optimization

Project for Nonlinear programming and evolutionary algorithms, 3rd Semester, Software Engineering and Informational Technologies, Faculty of Technical Sciences, Novi Sad 2024

For project specifications, it is hard coded to find the shortest path between two specific nodes, but can easily be changed to accept user input.

The main files are **main.py**, and in **data/** and **antcolony/** directories, the **extras/** directory is for files required by the project specification.

## Running the project
To run the project, first install the dependencies and then run the main.py file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
